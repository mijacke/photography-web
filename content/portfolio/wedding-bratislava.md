An intimate day that blended modern details with old-town backdrops. We started with a quiet first look, moved through narrow streets for portraits, and wrapped up with a golden-hour session by the river.

- Preparation photos in a minimalist apartment
- Ceremony in a historic courtyard
- Golden-hour portraits with architecture and water reflections
- Evening reception with warm, cinematic lighting

If you like this look, drop your date and venue and I'll tailor a simple shot list for you.
