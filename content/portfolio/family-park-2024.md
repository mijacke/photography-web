An easy-going afternoon session designed to feel like a walk, not a photoshoot. We picked a shaded spot for the smallest kids, mixed posed photos with candid games, and kept the edits clean and true to life.

- Warm-up stroll to get everyone comfortable
- Simple games to keep kids engaged
- Solo portraits for parents and grandparents
- Sunset silhouettes to close the gallery
